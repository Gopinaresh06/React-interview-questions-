1. what is difference between class and function components.
Function components :
  --> There is no render method used in functional components.
  --> Also known as Stateless components
  --> React lifecycle methods (for example, componentDidMount).
  --> Hooks can be easily used in functional components to make them Stateful.
  --> Constructors are not used.
Class components :
  --> It must have the render()
  --> Also known as Stateful components because they implement logic and state.
  --> React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (for example, componentDidMount).
  --> Constructor is used as it needs to store state.
